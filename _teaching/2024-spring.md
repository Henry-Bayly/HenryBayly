I was a teaching assistant for this course. It contained about 35 MPH students, most of which were concentrating in biostatistics. This is the description of the course: "Emphasis is placed on the use of intermediate-level programming with the SAS statistical computer package to perform analyses using statistical models with emphasis on linear models. Computing topics include advanced data file manipulation, concatenating and merging data sets, working with date variables, array and do-loop programming, and macro construction. Statistical topics include analysis of variance and covariance, multiple linear regression, principal component and factor analysis, linear models for correlated data, and statistical power." I held office hours and gave 2 guest lectures on introductory SAS coding and topics in multiple linear regression.

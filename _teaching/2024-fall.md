I was a teaching assistant for this course. It contained about 60 MPH, MA, and PhD students, most of which were concentrating in biostatistics. This is the description of the course: "This course covers study design and intermediate-level data analysis techniques for handling confounding in epidemiologic studies. Confounding is carefully defined and distinguished from interaction. Course content covers stratification and multivariable techniques for controlling confounding in both matched and independent sample study designs, including analysis of covariance, logistic regression, and proportional hazards models. Model fit and prediction are discussed. Students are required to apply these methods with the aid of computerized statistical packages." I held office hours and held exam review sessions. The course was taught in R and SAS.

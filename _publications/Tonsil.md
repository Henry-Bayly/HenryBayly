This study highlights the influence of patient demographics and regional factors on hospital charges for pediatric tonsillectomy in OSA cases. These findings underscore the importance of addressing potential disparities in healthcare access and resource allocation to ensure equitable care for children with OSA. Efforts should be made to promote fair and affordable treatment for all pediatric OSA patients, regardless of their demographic backgrounds.

The Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area, with an estimated population of 2.46 million, experiences elevated fine particulate (PM2.5) air pollution levels due to a combination of industrial activity and traffic-related emissions, exacerbated by the regionâ€™s distinct topographical features that trap pollutants. Using spatial analysis and pairwise comparisons, this observational investigation quantifies the relationship between satellite-derived PM2.5 exposure levels and social deprivation at the census block group level, revealing environmental injustices that are often obscured in aggregate-level analyses.

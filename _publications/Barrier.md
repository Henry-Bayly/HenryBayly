Successful recruitment of study participants is a challenging component of research, and recruitment barriers are amplified in safety-net hospital (SNH) settings. However, engaging historically underrepresented groups in research is critically important to improve health disparities and outcomes. We summarize challenges we encountered while recruiting patients with COVID-19 from the emergency department (ED), actions to improve inclusivity, and implementation hurdles in an SNH setting.

Appointment non-attendance in otolaryngology is influenced by various demographic and socioeconomic factors, with significant disparities observed among racial and ethnic groups. The COVID-19 pandemic altered attendance patterns, highlighting the potential benefits of telemedicine. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address healthcare disparities and improve appointment adherence, particularly among minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Future research should incorporate patient perspectives to better understand barriers to appointment attendance.

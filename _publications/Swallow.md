This study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing patient attendance at SLP appointments for pediatric swallowing disorders. Having a PCP at the medical center and utilizing telemedicine appointments were associated with higher attendance rates. Addressing appointment cancellations and investigating underlying reasons behind missed appointments should be prioritized in future research. Understanding these factors will facilitate the development of interventions to optimize patient attendance and improve the delivery of SLP services in pediatric populations.
